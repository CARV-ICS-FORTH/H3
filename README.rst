H3
===

H3 is an embedded High speed, High volume, and High availability object store, backed by a high-performance key-value store (Kreon, RocksDB, etc.) or a filesystem. H3 is implemented in the h3lib library, which provides a cloud-friendly API, similar to Amazon's S3. Python and Java wrappers are also available.

For more details, consult the `documentation <docs/>`_.

H3 is developed by the `Computer Architecture and VLSI Systems (CARV) <https://www.ics.forth.gr/carv/>`_ lab of the `Institute of Computer Science (ICS) <https://www.ics.forth.gr>`_ at the `Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (FORTH) <https://www.ics.forth.gr>`_ and is available under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
