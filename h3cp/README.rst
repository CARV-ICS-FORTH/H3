h3cp utility
============

``h3cp`` is simple example in `Go <https://golang.org>`_ that uses ``h3lib`` to copy files to and from H3::

    Usage: h3cp -s <storage_uri> <src> <dst>

**Note:** Use the ``h3://<bucket>/<object>`` notation to reference H3 objects.

To build, compile and install ``h3lib``, then run ``make``.
